* sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel -y (This command installs the JAVA JDK which is use by Jenkins)
* sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo (This command pulls Jenkins repo to our machine)
* sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key (This command imports a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package)
*  sudo yum install jenkins -y (installing jenkins)
* sudo systemctl start jenkins (starting jenkins service)
* sudo systemctl enable jenkins (enabling the jenkins service across server restarts)
* sudo systemctl status jenkins (ensuring jenkins service is up and running)
